# Instruction to deploy container locally
CD into ISB directory & run the following commands: 
- 'docker-compose build' builds the image for the Django app's container, and download all required python packages.
    * If new packages are added, they need to be added into requirements.txt and execute the command again.
    * If back-end logics and settings are changed, execute the command again.
- 'docker-compose up' would create container instances for postgres database and the django app and run on port 5432 and port 8000 of localhost, respectively
    * Changes in front-end codes are listened to and applied by Django instantly.
